        <h1>Assignments</h1>

        <p>This course is heavily focused on self-directed learning, where you have certain tasks to accomplish by
            specific due dates, but you may work faster and actually <strong>should strive to get ahead if you
                can</strong>. More material and resources can definitely be provided for any student(s) who wants to
            explore web tools more deeply. That said, the trick is that <strong>you will be working in groups</strong>
            so your pace will be somewhat constrained by how well your teammates and you support each other.
            Additionally, all of the groups will form a larger <strong>learning community</strong> where everyone helps
            each other with their individual learning goals.</p>

        <p>For most of the assignments, the main process that is expected from students is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>read the sample page for the assignment,</li>
            <li>view the source code for the sample page (right-click and View Page Source or hit F12) and then read the
                code and the comments within the code,</li>
            <li>identify which web resources to consult to learn about the items that are required for the assignment,
                and</li>
            <li>follow the web resources while working with teammates to complete the assignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main resource to use is <a href="https://w3schools.com">w3schools</a>, but there are A TON of other web
            resources that could help, including a whole bunch of good ones to check out on the <a
                href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

        <p><strong>Each task has a certain number of points</strong> associated with it. For some of the tasks, it's
            just a binary: <em>did you do it or not in a timely manner?</em> For others, there's some wiggle room for
            how many points you receive, and receiving the maximum means that not only have you done the task but you've
            done it such that I can tell there was thought and care put into it (i.e., you checked the code for syntax
            errors, you left intelligible comments, etc.). For all of the group work, obviously, a lot will depend on
            the coordination of the group, but each student will be keeping a <a
                id="learningjournals"></a><strong>Learning Journal</strong>
            where they can indicate their thoughts on the work and how they could improve it. In fact, in many cases,
            good and detailed reflective writing in this journal is more important than just doing the task.</p>

        <p><strong>Learning Journal</strong> entries should be at least two or three pages long, including
            diagrams, screenshots, photos, links to videos, etc. Use these prompts to help you think of what to include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>What you did.</em> Write about things that didn't work or alternative approaches you needed to come
                up with. Detail is important. Think of this as sort of a documentary or a behind-the-scenes look at the
                process.</li>
            <li><em>What you learned.</em> Include how you think you learned it and whether there was a particular
                resource or concept that you can highlight that helped you learn how to do the task. Link or insert any
                resources you used especially if one was particularly helpful that you think others would find useful!
            </li>
            <li><em>What worked well about the process.</em> Include thoughts on group work and how the group
                coordinated and communicated and how this could be improved. Also, write about your own personal
                process. Are you devoting enough time to the assignments? Are you scheduling regular times to work? Are
                you posting questions and answering others on Discord?</li>
            <li><em>Next steps.</em> What you plan on trying next if you're currently stuck on a problem or have ideas
                for new things to try. How you will adjust what you've been doing based on what's happened so far.</li>
            <li><em>Screenshots.</em> Please remember to include screenshots of work. Show us code that you worked on
                and the final pages that the code created!</li>
            <li><em>Collaborative efforts.</em> Be sure to write down a short description of how you gave or received
                help!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Try to be detailed with specificity so that someone reading it can picture in their mind how you did the
            things you did. It may help to pretend you're going to read this five years from now. What sorts of details
            would you want to see so you remember what you worked on and, more importantly, how you solved any issues as
            they came up.</p>

        <p>If it's clear that you're putting time and effort into the reflection, you'll receive full points.</p>

                            <p>Each student is expected to treat the <em>class as a studio</em> where everyone is
                                helping everyone else out. <strong>Use Discord to offer help to others</strong>, even
                                those not in your group. Also, be sure to <strong>ask for help</strong> if you need it.
                                This course flows much better when we're all concentrating on learning together rather
                                than individually. Some students will have an easier time with the content (maybe
                                they've coded before), and some may learn differently. I strongly believe all students
                                can learn the course material; it's just a matter of time and of finding the right
                                approaches and resources for them.</p>
                            <p>Each group is expected to <strong>meet at least once a week</strong>, either on their own
                                or during class.</p>
                            <p>Groups are also expected to <strong>post a quick update</strong> in their Discord channel
                                of what's been
                                going on each week so part of your weekly meeting could be to generate that status
                                report for us.</p>
                            <p>Please indicate in your learning journals what you did to give and receive help whenever
                                possible!</p>
                            <p><strong>It helps A LOT if you approach group work with compassion, generosity, and
                                    curiosity.</strong> Don't assume things about each other, and be genuinely curious
                                about their lives. If anyone seems to be participating less than they should be, figure
                                out how you can help them stay on top of their work by asking what they need rather than
                                just yelling at them or not saying anything and building up resentment.</p>

                                clarification, and/or generally posting reactions. Each week, a student's Perusall
                                annotations are worth up to 1 or 2 points (1 point is considered full credit, but it's
                                possible to get 2 if you contribute a lot), depending on a number of factors including
                                quality and quantity of annotations throughout the documents, commenting on and/or
                                upvoting other people's annotations, etc. For 1 point, you're expected to do at least
                                three good notes per reading.</p>

                            <p>Each student should create a page and name it "username.html" so that the repository has
                                a collection of files, each named after a team member. Then the team should create an

                            <p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It uses tags around content to let a web
                                browser know what type of content it is, like this:
                                <code>&lt;p&gt;Here's a paragraph!&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                            <p>Tags often have attributes to specify specific properties. They appear in the opening tag
                                as <code>keyword=""</code> like this:
                                <code>&lt;p width="90%"&gt;Here's a paragraph that takes up 90% of the horizontal
                                    space!&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                                <li>Refer to the <a href="samplehtml.html">Sample HTML Page</a> for examples and a lot
                                    more information about how HTML works. You can right-click on the page and View Page
                                    Source to see the code. Alternatively, you can also hit F12 to see a panel on the
                                    right-hand side that shows a whole bunch of info about the page including a
                                    collapsed view of the source code. And, finally, a third way of seeing the code is
                                    to look at the Sample HTML page on the <a
                                        href="https://github.com/markdangerchen/markdangerchen.github.io">github
                                        repository for this course</a>. You could also save the page to your computer
                                    and then open it with VSCode.</li>
                                <li>After consulting the sample page, go to <a
                                        href="https://w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and look up each of the items in that
                                    list above and read those pages for lots of useful info about how to use those tags
                                    AND what they mean.</li>
                                <li>When working with github, you have to coordinate with each other so that two people
                                    aren't editing the same files at the same time. Github can technically help you sort
                                    stuff like that out, but it's easier if you just take turns working on files.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Therefore, it's suggested that one student should start, add stuff along
                                        with
                                        comments (see below), and then
                                        save their files and put them in the github repository.</li>
                                    <li>A second student in the team should then grab the files from the first student's
                                        github repository, edit them,, and put the edited files back into the first
                                        student's repo.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Keep handing it off to a new teammate, saving it to the first student's github
                                        each
                                        time, until all teammates have had a chance to edit the pages.</li>
                                    <li>You can keep doing this, not necessarily in a specific order, over and over,
                                        until
                                        all teammates are satisfied with their additions.</li>

                                    <li>Edited code should also be <code>&lt;!-- commented --&gt;</code> to detail any

                            <p>Each student should also <strong>add to their Learning Journal a reflection on this

                                    there. Use the Sample Pages as a model for this iterative development. Read the <a
                                        href="samplecss.html">Sample CSS Page</a> and its source code, and
                                    <strong>comment your code!</strong></li>
                                <li>If you get stuck even after referring to <a

                                <li><strong>Pro-tip!</strong> Before you submit the assignments, see if you can resolve
                                    any issues that VSCode detects for your page. You can see what VSCode deems as
                                    problems by opening the debug panel on the bottom of VSCode. You can make the panel
                                    show up in three ways: Move your mouse over the bottom bar until you see the up/down
                                    arrow and drag up, go to View-&gt;Appearance-&gt;Show Panel, OR just hit control-J.

                                        <li>a specific tag like, say, you want all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags to be
                                            styled in a particular way,</li>
                                        <li>only certain subsets of tags by using the <code>class=""</code> attribute in

                                            <li>A common use for a <code>class=""</code> attribute is to define

                                            using the <code>id=""</code> attribute and <code>#id</code> in the
                                            stylesheet.</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>This is often done to name a specific element (e.g., a specific
                                                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) so that you can make it do something when

                                            <li>(Making something centered is surprisingly finicky in HTML/CSS so see if
                                                you can find good resources on that specifically!)</li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <li>In general, you want to start using styles to define how different elements on

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>For example, start doing this:
                                            <code>&lt;table style="width: 90%; border: 2px;"&gt;</code> instead of:
                                            <code>&lt;table width="90%" border="2"&gt;</code></li>

                                but it needs to be inspired by a strong vision for what the project is. Potential
                                creations include portfolios, artwork, a page for an organization you belong to,
                                personal websites, etc. We'll use Google docs for the planning of these projects.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)">Bootstrap</a> is
                                a set of predefined styles and functions (AKA a <em>framework</em>) that a group of
                                developers have created and shared with the world as a resource for others so they don't
                                have to invent the wheel with each new website they create. It includes common ways to
                                structure and layout a page, using a grid system.</p>

                                <li><strong>Learn how the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/">grid
                                            system</a> works, and use it to structure your page.</strong> Basically,
                                    Bootstrap treats each page as having an invisible grid that is 12 columns wide and
                                    however many rows tall as is needed. You can use the grid to structure your page in
                                    a way that makes it easier to read and understand. You can also use the grid to
                                    create a responsive layout, which means that your page will work on all screen
                                    sizes.</li>
                                <li>Then include:</li>

                                    work on this, making sure to update the repo consistently (backups are good!). If
                                    you can, put
                                    your web files into your webspace (e.g., on your Reclaim Hosting space). You can do
                                    this in several ways. The easiest is to go through cpanel and upload it with the
                                    File Manager. Another way would be to link VSCode to your hosting site and have it
                                    automatically save files there. If you can't figure it out in time for this
                                    assignment due date, don't sweat it. We'll go over it in class and there's still a
                                    couple of weeks before you actually have to have something on your site.</li>

                            <p><strong>Show off your website project in its current form (5 pts).</strong> Individual
                                students should have ready for viewing their works-in-progress website with features
                                working and ready to test. Final aesthetics are not necessary, but the main forms of
                                interaction and sections should be there.</p>

                            <p>Each student will provide feedback to at least three other students' websites. You can do
                                this by visiting their website and then going to their Google doc to see their
                                wireframes, etc., and leaving comments there. Then go to the URL spreadsheet and
                                indicate which students you left feedback for.</p>

                                    the feedback they received and what they plan on changing (2 pts)</strong>. Start by
                                copying and pasting all of the feedback you received into your Google doc. Then sort
                                through it and order it based on topic or suggestion (it helps to see if multiple people
                                gave the same suggestion!). Then write a response for what you'll change or not based on
                                the feedback received.</p>

                        <div class="collapse" id="assn4">
                            <p>Ok, here's where it gets complicated fast. <strong>Javascript</strong> is a programming
                                language and many consider the skill ceiling for it much higher than just HTML/CSS. You
                                could study and use Javascript for years and still not feel like an expert. That means
                                this course must focus on introducing you to the resources available for continued
                                learning after the course is over. There are some fundamental components to any
                                programming language that you should learn. Getting that foundation down will help with
                                all programming languages in the future (and generally help you think logically in other
                                disciplines as well!).</p>

                            <p>For this assignment, you'll follow the same process as the other group work assignments
                                in creating a page on a different student's GitHub Pages, but it will be difficult just
                                seeing from the code whether all students "get it." This is another reason why the
                                <strong>Learning Journal</strong> is so important. Even if you don't fully understand, I
                                want to see evidence that you're earnestly trying and that you have a plan for moving
                                forward.</p>

                            <p>Hopefully, by now the course runs as a supportive community where we all help each other.
                                If you get stuck, just post a question on our online discussion board, come to an
                                optional session, or ask for help!</p>

                                <li>Declares a variable and set its value.</li>
                                <li>Uses an array (AKA a table of variables stored as a set).</li>
                                <li>Creates a function.</li>
                                <li>Tests conditional logic (AKA uses an if-then statement or a switch of some sort).
                                </li>
                                <li>Creates a loop that runs multiple times until some end condition is met.</li>
                                <li>Makes some element execute the function when clicked on or is interacted with
                                    somehow by the user.</li>

                                That said, sometimes you have to try multiple things in design before finding something
                                that works and moving forward in that direction, so it's not expected for you to have
                                super final polished versions of your project up. Do work that you're proud of. Document
                                these trials in your final reflection on the project.</p>
