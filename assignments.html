            <h1>Assignments</h1>

            <p>This course is heaviy focused on self-directed learning, where you have certain tasks to accomplish by specific due dates, but you may work faster and actually <strong>should strive to get ahead if you can</strong>. More material and resources can definitely be provided for any student(s) who wants to explore web tools more deeply. That said, the trick is that <strong>you will be working in groups of three</strong> so your pace will be somewhat constrained by how well your teammates and you support each other. Additionally, all of the groups will form a larger <strong>learning community</strong> where everyone helps each other with their individual learning goals.</p>

            <p><strong>Each task has a certain number of points</strong> associated with it. For some of the tasks, it's just a binary: <em>did you do it or not in a timely manner?</em> For others, there's some wiggle room for how many points you receive, and receiving the maximum means that not only have you done the task but you've done it such that I can tell there was thought and care put into it. For all of the group work, obviously, a lot will depend on the coordination of the group, but each student will be keeping a personal <strong>Learning Journal</strong> where they can indicate their thoughts on the work and how they could improve it. In fact, in many cases, good and detailed reflective writing in this journal is more important than just doing the task.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflective Learning Journal</strong> entries should be about one or two pages long and include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><em>What you did.</em> Include things that didn't work or alternative approaches you needed to come up with. Detail is important. Think of this as sort of a documentary or behind-the-scenes look at the process.
                <li><em>What you learned.</em> Include how you think you learned it and whether there was a particular resource or concept that you can highlight that helped you learn how to do the task.</li>
                <li><em>What worked well for the task.</em> Include thoughts on group work and how the group coordinated and communicated and how this could be improved.</li>
                <li>If you think it helps, feel free to include screenshots of work.</li>
            </ol>

                            <h5>Rapid Prototyping WordPress + Beginning of Course Miscellany</h5>
                            <div class="collapse" id="assn0">
                                <p><strong>Get acquainted with course materials:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Familiarize yourself with this course website.</li>
                                    <li>Browse the <a href="resources.html">Resources Page</a>. In particular, check out <a href="https://w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> for examples, references, and tutorials.</li>
                                    <li>Acquire textbooks (optional): <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/"><cite>HTML & CSS</cite> and <cite>Javascript & jQuery</cite></a>, both by Jon Duckett - Super clear and well-designed reference books!</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Get set up with course platforms (2 pts):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Join the course's Google Team Drive. This is where we'll store collaborative documents that we can all contribute to and comment on in addition to your individual learning journals.</li>
                                    <li>Install the <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> mobile and/or desktop app, create an account (if you don't already have one), and join the group that will be sent out via Canvas.</li>
                                    <li>Introduce yourself in Discord in the appropriate channel and also indicate what your schedule will be for the quarter so that we can form small groups better.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Register domain name and get hosting (2 pts):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Register a domain name (AKA a unique label that you'll own that you can have point to a specific address on the internet). I personally use <a href="https://namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>, but there are a ton of options out there... It should cost less than $15 for a year.</li>
                                    <li>Get hosting (AKA the address or location on the internet where you'll store your stuff). <a href="https://freehosting.com">Freehosting</a> seem like a good, easy-to-use choice and it's free, but, again, there are a ton out there. You could pay for hosting with namecheap or vice versa you could register (and pay) for a domain name with Freehosting, saving you a step.</li>
                                    <li>Link your domain name to your hosting account by telling the domain name registrar where to lookup where your domain name is pointing to (AKA tell the domain name registrar what nameserver/domain name system (DNS) to use to store where your domain name points to). Each hosting company uses their own DNS. You can sort of think of these as like apartment buildings. When someone tries to go to your domain, your registrar will say, ok, now go to this DNS (apartment building) to look up where that domain actually resides (the specific apartment).</li>
                                    <li>It'll look something like <code>NS1.FREEHOSTING.COM</code>.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> All of this takes time. Registering a domain name, getting a hosting account, linking DNS... they can take time for the internet to update, and, also, it can take time to verify who you are with the service providers (AKA they may send you an email confirmation, etc.), so be prepared for this initial set up to take a day or two.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Install WordPress and set up a portfolio (5 pts + 1 for helping someone else out with this):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>WordPress comes in two flavors. There's the free version, which you may have used before for other courses, at wordpress.com, but there's also the software platform that you can install onto any web server. This latter version is what you'll be using, and it comes with much more control over set up and customization.</li>
                                    <li>Pick theme, browse and install plugins, set up rapid portfolio.</li>
                                    <li>Steps to follow and tips and tricks can be found in the WordPress document in our Google Team Drive.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <h5>Setting Up Workflow and Forming Groups</h5>
                            <div class="collapse" id="assn1">
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Set up GitHub Pages, VSCode, CodePen, and workflow (1 pt).</strong> Steps can be found in the Workflow Document in our Google Team Drive.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Form groups of three (1 pt)</strong>, trade contact info, set up your own Discord channel, and enter in your GitHub Pages URLs in the Google doc we'll be using as the portal page. We'll determine the groups using mojo, heavily influenced by your Discord introductions, but, if you want to work with someone in particular, be sure to let me know.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Create a Learning Journal (3 pts)</strong> using Google docs to use for the rest of the quarter in the appropriate folder in our Google Team Drive. Write your first entry, reflecting on all this initial set up and on using WordPress.</li>

It includes common ways to structure and layout a page, using a grid system.</p>

                                <p>Ok, here's where it gets complicated fast. <strong>Javascript</strong> is a programming language and many consider the skill ceiling for it much higher than just HTML/CSS. You could study and use Javascript for years and still not feel like an expert. That means this course must focus on introducing you to the resources available for continued learning after the course is over. There's some fundamental components to any programming language that you should learn. Getting that foundation down will help with all programming languages in the future (and generally help you think logically in other disciplines as well!).</p>

                                <p>For this assignment, you'll follow the same process as the others in creating a page on a student's GitHub Pages (just rotate to the first student's account), but it will be difficult just seeing from the code whether all three students "get it." This is another reason why the <strong>Learning Journal</strong> is so important. Even if you don't fully understand, I want to see evidence that you're earnestly trying and that you have a plan for moving forward.</p>

                                    <li>Use an array (AKA a table of variables stored as a set).</li>
                                    <li>Create a function.</li>
                                    <li>Throw in some conditional logic (AKA an if-then statement or a switch of some sort).</li>
                                    <li>Create a loop that runs multiple times until some end condition is met.</li>
                                    <li>Make some element execute the function when clicked on or is interacted with somehow by the user.</li>

Also, be sure to <strong>ask for help</strong> if you need it. This flows much better when we're all concentrating on learning together rather than individually. Some students will have an easier time with the content (maybe they've coded before), and some may learn differently. I strongly believe all students can get this material; it's just a matter of time and of finding the right approaches and resources for them.</p>
