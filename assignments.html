            <h1>Assignments</h1>

            <p>This course is heaviy focused on self-directed learning, where you have certain tasks to accomplish by specific due dates, but you may work faster and actually <strong>should strive to get ahead if you can</strong>. More material and resources can definitely be provided for any student(s) who wants to explore web tools more deeply. That said, the trick is that <strong>you will be working in groups</strong> so your pace will be somewhat constrained by how well your teammates and you support each other. Additionally, all of the groups will form a larger <strong>learning community</strong> where everyone helps each other with their individual learning goals.</p>

            <p>For most of the assignments, the main process that is expected from students is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>read the sample page for the assignment,</li>
                <li>view the source code for the sample page (right-click and View Page Source or hit F12) and then read the code and the comments within the code,</li>
                <li>identify which web resources to consult to learn about the items that are required for the assignment, and</li>
                <li>follow the web resources while working with teammates to complete the assignment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The main resource to use is <a href="https://w3schools.com">w3schools</a>, but there are A TON of other web resources that could help, including a whole bunch of good ones to check out on the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

            <p><strong>Each task has a certain number of points</strong> associated with it. For some of the tasks, it's just a binary: <em>did you do it or not in a timely manner?</em> For others, there's some wiggle room for how many points you receive, and receiving the maximum means that not only have you done the task but you've done it such that I can tell there was thought and care put into it (i.e., you checked the code for syntax errors, you left intelligible comments, etc.). For all of the group work, obviously, a lot will depend on the coordination of the group, but each student will be keeping a personal <strong>Learning Journal</strong> where they can indicate their thoughts on the work and how they could improve it. In fact, in many cases, good and detailed reflective writing in this journal is more important than just doing the task.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflective Learning Journal</strong> entries should be about one or two pages long and include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>What you did.</em> Include things that didn't work or alternative approaches you needed to come up with. Detail is important. Think of this as sort of a documentary or behind-the-scenes look at the process.</li>
                <li><em>What you learned.</em> Include how you think you learned it and whether there was a particular resource or concept that you can highlight that helped you learn how to do the task.</li>
                <li><em>What worked well for the task.</em> Include thoughts on group work and how the group coordinated and communicated and how this could be improved.</li>
                <li><em>Next steps.</em> What you plan on trying next if you're currently stuck on a problem or have ideas for new things to try. How you will adjust what you've been doing based on what's happened so far.</li>
                <li><em>Screenshots.</em> When talking about specific issues or things you learned, please include screenshots of work to help illustrate what you're talking about.</li>
                <li><em>Collaborative efforts.</em> Be sure to write down a short description of how you gave or received help!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If it's clear that you're putting time and effort into the reflection, you'll receive full points.</p>

                                <p>Each student is expected to treat the <em>class as a studio</em> where everyone is helping everyone else out. <strong>Use Discord to offer help to others</strong>, even those not in your group. Also, be sure to <strong>ask for help</strong> if you need it. This course flows much better when we're all concentrating on learning together rather than individually. Some students will have an easier time with the content (maybe they've coded before), and some may learn differently. I strongly believe all students can learn the course material; it's just a matter of time and of finding the right approaches and resources for them.</p>
                                <p>Each group is expected to meet at least once a week, either on their own or during class on Mondays and/or during the optional Wednesdays.</p>
                                <p>Groups are also expected to post in their Discord channel a quick update of what's been going on each week so part of your weekly meeting could be to generate that status report for us.</p>
                                <p>Please indicate in your learning journals what you did to give and receive help whenever possible!</p>

                                    <li>Install the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> mobile and/or desktop app, create an account (if you don't already have one), and join the group that will be sent out via Canvas.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Introduce yourself in Discord (1 pt)</strong> in the appropriate channel and also indicate what your schedule will be for the quarter so that we can form small groups better.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Create a Learning Journal (2 pts)</strong> using Google docs to use for the rest of the quarter in the Individual Learning Journals folder in our Google Shared Drive. Write your first entry, reflecting on all this initial set up, how comfortable you are with coding already, what your expectations for the course are, etc.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Form teams (1 pt)</strong>, fill in a Team Plan/Contract (provided through Canvas), start using your team's Discord channel, and enter in your GitHub Pages URLs in the Google doc we'll be using as the portal page. We'll determine the groups using mojo, heavily influenced by your Discord introductions, but, if you want to work with someone in particular, be sure to let us know. Teams may use other communication mediums in addition to Discord, but we expect each student to post at least once once a week on the platform to keep the instructors and teammates updated on their work. For the team contract, just copy that Google doc into your team folder in Google Drive and fill it out.</li>
                                    <li>Each teammate's github account should be added as contributors to all teammate's github repositories.</li>

                                        <li>and images with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, using the <em>attributes</em> <code>src="url"</code>, <code>alt="alternative text"</code>, mostly for screen readers, and <code>title="label here"</code> that show up on mouse hover</li>

You can right-click on the page and View Page Source to see the code. Alternatively, you can also hit F12 to see a panel on the right hand side that shows a whole bunch of info about the page including a collapsed view of the source code. And, finally, a third way of seeing the code is to look at the Sample HTML page on the <a href="https://github.com/markdangerchen/markdangerchen.github.io">github repository for this course</a>. You could also save the page to your computer and then open it with VSCode.</li>
                                    <li>After consulting the sample page, go to <a href="https://w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and look up each of the items in that list above and read those pages for lots of useful info about how to use those tags AND what they mean.</li>
                                    <li>One student should start a page, add stuff along with comments (see below), and then save it and put it in their github repository.</li>
                                    <li>A second student in the team should then grab the page from the first student's github, edit it, and put the edited file back into the first student's github.</li>
                                    <li>Keep handing it off to a new teammate, saving it to the first student's github each time, until all teammates have had a chance to edit the page.</li>
                                    <li>You can keep doing this, not necessarily in a specific order, over and over until all teammates are satisfied with their additions.</li>
                                    <li>Each student should contribute the above items (although <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, and <code>body</code> should only appear ONCE on the page), and each student should also include:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>&lt;!-- A comment with purpose of new code and mention of the source or inspiration for added code. --&gt;</code></li>
                                        <li>Edited code should also be <code>&lt;!-- commented --&gt;</code> to detail any changes made from previous versions.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>

                                <p>One of the things that you should learn how to do is to set up your own webspace and get your own domain name so you have somewhere to call home and to place all your actual web work. You'll be using this space for your individual projects instead of your GitHub Pages, which we're reserving for your team work.</p>
                                <p><strong>Register domain name and get hosting:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Get a $45 hosting account with Reclaim Hosting (who focus on empowering students with their own web presence that students then own and control absolutely), which comes with a free domain name registration! <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">https://reclaimhosting.com/</a> (Let us know if this is a hardship for you and we can try to find other options, but this course doesn't have required textbooks so, hopefully, this cost is okay.)</li>
                                    <li>After you register an account and get set up, you can visit your client portal at <a href="https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/clientarea.php">https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/clientarea.php</a></li>
                                    <li>Note: If you already have a domain name and hosting, you can skip the above steps, but let us know!</li>
                                    <li><strong>Put the URL of your new webspace in a common Google doc we'll be using as the portal page (3 pts).</strong></li>
                                    <li>We'll provide a guide in Canvas and Google on how to do all this!</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Familiarize yourself with cpanel:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reclaim Hosting (and other hosting companies) provide a dashboard for your site including a control panel (cpanel).</li>
                                    <li>Browse through the control panel options and try to get a sense of what tools and options are available.</li>
                                    <li>There are multiple ways to put .html files you create onto your new web space. One of them is through the file manager in cpanel. We'll show how to do this in class later. <strong>For now, just put the URL into the Google spreadsheet that we have going. (2 pts)</strong></li>
                                    <li>We'll communicate in class and via Canvas/Discord some more specific things you should check out.</li>

                                <p>Ok, here's where it gets complicated fast. <strong>Javascript</strong> is a programming language and many consider the skill ceiling for it much higher than just HTML/CSS. You could study and use Javascript for years and still not feel like an expert. That means this course must focus on introducing you to the resources available for continued learning after the course is over. There are some fundamental components to any programming language that you should learn. Getting that foundation down will help with all programming languages in the future (and generally help you think logically in other disciplines as well!).</p>

                                <p>For this assignment, you'll follow the same process as the other group work assignments in creating a page on a different student's GitHub Pages, but it will be difficult just seeing from the code whether all students "get it." This is another reason why the <strong>Learning Journal</strong> is so important. Even if you don't fully understand, I want to see evidence that you're earnestly trying and that you have a plan for moving forward.</p>

                                <p>Hopefully, by now the course runs as a supportive community where we all help each other. If you get stuck, just post a question on our online discussion board, come to an optional session, or ask for help!</p>

                                    <li>Declares a variable and set its value.</li>
                                    <li>Uses an array (AKA a table of variables stored as a set).</li>
                                    <li>Creates a function.</li>
                                    <li>Tests conditional logic (AKA uses an if-then statement or a switch of some sort).</li>
                                    <li>Creates a loop that runs multiple times until some end condition is met.</li>
                                    <li>Makes some element execute the function when clicked on or is interacted with somehow by the user.</li>

                                <p>Individual websites are due to show off in class. They should have a strong vision and clear evidence of your best execution of that vision given the constraints in place. That said, sometimes you have to try multiple things in design before finding something that works and moving forward in that direction, so it's not expected for you to have super final polished versions of your project up. Do work that you're proud of. Document these trials in your final reflection on the project.</p>

                                <p>Tasks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Submit final website. (5 pts)</strong></li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Update your files.</strong> Make sure the files on your web host are the latest versions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Comment your code!</strong></li>

                                    <li><strong>Append a new section to your Individual Project Google doc (5 pts)</strong> that includes a refined statement of intent (if it needs it), and then write a one or two page reflection on the process of making the project. Be sure to include things you tried that didn't work! Also, include screenshots or diagrams or whatever other evidence you think would make a complete documentary of your work. We want to see hyper-detailed debrief and evidence of your process and thoughts during the process.</li>
