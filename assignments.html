            <h1>Assignments</h1>

            <p>This course is heaviy focused on self-directed learning, where you have certain tasks to accomplish by specific due dates, but you may work faster and actually <strong>should strive to get ahead if you can</strong>. More material and resources can definitely be provided for any student(s) who wants to explore web tools more deeply. That said, the trick is that <strong>you will be working in groups</strong> so your pace will be somewhat constrained by how well your teammates and you support each other. Additionally, all of the groups will form a larger <strong>learning community</strong> where everyone helps each other with their individual learning goals.</p>

            <p><strong>Each task has a certain number of points</strong> associated with it. For some of the tasks, it's just a binary: <em>did you do it or not in a timely manner?</em> For others, there's some wiggle room for how many points you receive, and receiving the maximum means that not only have you done the task but you've done it such that I can tell there was thought and care put into it (i.e., you checked the code for syntax errors, you left intelligible comments, etc.). For all of the group work, obviously, a lot will depend on the coordination of the group, but each student will be keeping a personal <strong>Learning Journal</strong> where they can indicate their thoughts on the work and how they could improve it. In fact, in many cases, good and detailed reflective writing in this journal is more important than just doing the task.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflective Learning Journal</strong> entries should be about one or two pages long and include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>What you did.</em> Include things that didn't work or alternative approaches you needed to come up with. Detail is important. Think of this as sort of a documentary or behind-the-scenes look at the process.</li>
                <li><em>What you learned.</em> Include how you think you learned it and whether there was a particular resource or concept that you can highlight that helped you learn how to do the task.</li>
                <li><em>What worked well for the task.</em> Include thoughts on group work and how the group coordinated and communicated and how this could be improved.</li>
                <li><em>Next steps.</em> What you plan on trying next if you're currently stuck on a problem or have ideas for new things to try. How you will adjust what you've been doing based on what's happened so far.</li>
                <li><em>Screenshots.</em> When talking about specific issues or things you learned, please include screenshots of work to help illustrate what you're talking about.</li>
                <li><em>Collaborative efforts.</em> Be sure to write down a short description of how you gave or received help!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If it's clear that you're putting time and effort into the reflection, you'll receive full points.</p>

                                <p>Each student is expected to treat the <em>class as a studio</em> where everyone is helping everyone else out. <strong>Use Discord to offer help to others</strong>, even those not in your group. Also, be sure to <strong>ask for help</strong> if you need it. This course flows much better when we're all concentrating on learning together rather than individually. Some students will have an easier time with the content (maybe they've coded before), and some may learn differently. I strongly believe all students can learn the course material; it's just a matter of time and of finding the right approaches and resources for them.</p>
                                <p>Each group is expected to meet at least once a week, either on their own or during class on Mondays and/or during the optional Wednesdays.</p>
                                <p>Groups are also expected to post in their Discord channel a quick update of what's been going on each week so part of your weekly meeting could be to generate that status report for us.</p>
                                <p>Please indicate in your learning journals what you did to give and receive help whenever possible!</p>

We'll determine the groups using mojo, heavily influenced by your Discord introductions, but, if you want to work with someone in particular, be sure to let us know. Teams may use other communication mediums in addition to Discord, but we expect each student to post at least once once a week on the platform to keep the instructors and teammates updated on their work. For the team contract, just copy that Google doc into your team folder in Google Drive and fill it out.</li>

                                <p>Ok, here's where it gets complicated fast. <strong>Javascript</strong> is a programming language and many consider the skill ceiling for it much higher than just HTML/CSS. You could study and use Javascript for years and still not feel like an expert. That means this course must focus on introducing you to the resources available for continued learning after the course is over. There's some fundamental components to any programming language that you should learn. Getting that foundation down will help with all programming languages in the future (and generally help you think logically in other disciplines as well!).</p>

                                <p>For this assignment, you'll follow the same process as the other group work assignments in creating a page on a fourth student's GitHub Pages, but it will be difficult just seeing from the code whether all students "get it." This is another reason why the <strong>Learning Journal</strong> is so important. Even if you don't fully understand, I want to see evidence that you're earnestly trying and that you have a plan for moving forward.</p>

                                <p>Individual websites are due to show off in class. They should have a strong vision and clear evidence of your best execution of that vision given the constraints in place. That said, sometimes you have to try multiple things in design before finding something that works and moving forward in that direction, so it's not expected for you to have super final polished versions of your project up. Do work that you're proud of. Document these trials in your final reflection on the project.</p>

                                <p>Tasks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Submit final website. (5 pts)</strong></li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Update your files.</strong> Make sure the files on either your web host are the latest versions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Comment your code!</strong></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li><strong>Append a new section to your Individual Project Google doc (5 pts)</strong> that includes a refined statement of intent (if it needs it), and then write a one or two page reflection on the process of making the project. Be sure to include things you tried that didn't work! Also, include screenshots or diagrams or whatever other evidence you think would make a complete documentary of your work. We want to see hyper-detailed debrief and evidence of your process and thoughts during the process.</li>
