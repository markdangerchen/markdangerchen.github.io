            <h1>UWB BIMD 233 Info Page and Index</h1>

            <p>This page will help you get started with UWB's BIMD 233 Web Tehcnologies course with Dr. Mark Chen. If I'm feel particularly nifty, I'll convert this into the syllabus eventually. For now, it's mostly just acting as the portal page to the sample pages that you can refer to while learning HTML/CSS + JS.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a list of what's available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="samplehtml.html">Sample HTML Page</a></li>
                <li><a href="samplecss.html">Sample CSS Page</a></li>
                <li><a href="samplejs.html">Sample JS Page</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The intent is that you'd go to each page and right-click on an empty portion of the page to View Source OR hit F12 in your browser to view the code. Then you can see examples of how certain tags work in action and start to understand proper syntax and such.</p>

            <p>Each page gets progressively more complex, the first one being relatively simple HTML. There's a lot more to each of the languages, though, so these pages are just meant as the first step and bare minimum you're expected to understand by the end of the quarter. If you want to learn how to do other things not covered (like, for exmaple, create a web form), there's other ways to find that info out once you have the basics down.</p>
            
            <p>The course is meant to introduce the basics and then teach you how to find more information on your own. This is actually how I run almost all of my courses. I'm more interested in helping people figure out how to continue improving or learning after taking one of my courses than I am in getting them to do specific things just for the course.</p>

            <h3>HTML, CSS, and Javascript Tutorials and Reference Sites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> - A comprehensive list of HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. features with sample code and mini-testbeds to try it all out. You could use this for the tutorials, but you could also keep this on hand as a reference for tag and syntax lookup.</li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Introduction_to_Web_development">MDN web docs</a> - The beginning page for an introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript made by Mozilla (who have the fancy logo moz://a now...). They're the makers of the Firefox browser and have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">in the web game basically since the beginning of the modern web</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">MDN web docs JavaScript Guide</a> - In case you need to jump directly to the JS stuff from moz://a, here's the link.</li>

Lots of you may prefer learning from watching tutorial videos rather than by perusing online manuals or textbooks. If so, there's a crap ton out there. This one seems pretty good.</li>
