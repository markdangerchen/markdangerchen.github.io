            <p>Welcome to UW Bothell's BIMD233: Web Tehcnologies course with Dr. Mark Chen! Here you'll find details about the course, the main assignment schedule, and resources to help complete the assignments.</p>

                <div class="col-xl-10 border">
                    <p>This course will introduce students to web design and coding the look and feel of webpages using HTML/CSS and Javascript.</p>

                    <p>The learning approach is not like a traditional exercise-focused course, and there will be very few lectures and quizzes. Instead, a heavy emphasis will be placed on self-directed learning and connected learning models, where students are expected to invest in their own learning processes, identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses and learning how to find resources that complement those aspects of their learning profiles to support them for success. There's a deep well of expertise to acquire regarding web design, so the course must focus on preparing students for continued learning even beyond this one course. Additionally, these skills should transfer to other learning topics.</p>
                        
                    <p>Students will form a studio-style learning community, tasked with learning along with and supporting their peers while working on specific assignments that are relatively freeform in content and purpose. Many examples of existing code will be given for students to mimic in order to learn specific techniques and syntax, but the emphasis for this course will be to cover general design processes while planning out and creating logical web flows through human-centered design.</p>
                        
                    <p>Final projects will be to hand-code a portfolio website, a work of art using HTML/CSS, or another project of the students' choosing, working with the instructor to scope out and plan the project.</p>

            <h3>Sample Pages</h3>

            <p>Be sure the look at the Samples Pages! The intent is that you'd go to each page and right-click on an empty portion of the page to View Source OR hit F12 in your browser to view the code. Then you can see examples of how certain tags work in action and start to understand proper syntax and such.</p>

            <p>Each page gets progressively more complex, the first one being relatively simple HTML. There's a lot more to each of the languages, though, so these pages are just meant as the first step and bare minimum you're expected to understand by the end of the quarter. If you want to learn how to do other things not covered (like, for exmaple, create a web form), there's other ways to find that info out once you have the basics down.</p>
            
            <p>The course is meant to introduce the basics and then teach you how to find more information on your own. This is actually how I run almost all of my courses. I'm more interested in helping people figure out how to continue improving or learning after taking one of my courses than I am in getting them to do specific things just for the course.</p>

You could use this for the tutorials, but you could also keep this on hand as a reference for tag and syntax lookup.</li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Introduction_to_Web_development">MDN web docs</a> - The beginning page for an introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript made by Mozilla (who have the fancy logo moz://a now...). They're the makers of the Firefox browser and have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">in the web game basically since the beginning of the modern web</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">MDN web docs JavaScript Guide</a> - In case you need to jump directly to the JS stuff from moz://a, here's the link.</li>

Lots of you may prefer learning from watching tutorial videos rather than by perusing online manuals or textbooks. If so, there's a crap ton out there. This one seems pretty good.</li>
