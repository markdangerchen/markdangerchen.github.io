                <h1>Sample Javascript Page</h1>

                <p>
                    This page started with the Sample Bootstrap Page and added a bunch
                    of Javascript behaviors into it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main purpose of this page is to give you examples of how to use
                    different ways to edit the way a page's different elements react to
                    user input. Most of the input has to do with mouse events that then
                    tell the page to run some code. Since this course isn't about making
                    websites that deal with data from some server but rather just the
                    look and feel of pages, most of the reactions that we'll be doing
                    are interface or visual effects. These serve to give users feedback
                    and make the page feel responsive and like it acknowledges that the
                    user has done something. With CSS, you could do some of this already
                    with built-in event detectors like the <code>hover</code> state of a
                    text element. And actually, we've cheated a little bit already with
                    Bootstrap since it does already have some simple visual effects that
                    use Javascript, like collapsing blocks of code (by toggling its
                    visibility--and actually, technically, there's at least
                    <a href="https://alligator.io/css/collapsible/">one way to collapse an element through pure
                        CSS</a>...).
                </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2>Intro</h2>

                <p>
                    Javascript is an actual programming language where you define
                    functions for the page to execute when something happens. Often when
                    you want it to do something, you also want to throw in some
                    conditional logic. For example, let's say your user clicks on a cell
                    in a table that displays a calendar month, and you want some pop-up
                    text to let the user know they clicked on the cell but you also want
                    it to know whether the date is even or odd or if it is a weekend day
                    rather than a weekday and intelligently display text in the pop-up
                    depending on those conditions. If you didn't have Javascript, you'd
                    have to define different class styles for each set of conditions and
                    remember to make sure each cell has the right classes. Then you'd
                    have to create a button in each cell or something and have the user
                    click on the button for the pop-up to appear.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With Javascript, you could instead have one class defined for every
                    cell in the table (or actually not even have to define a class) and
                    then add in an <code>onclick</code> event to whatever element you
                    want clickable. The code will then execute and identify what's in
                    the cell to determine if it's an odd or even number and which day it
                    is. Then it'll throw a pop-up and the text will be different
                    depending on what it detected.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2>Variables, Conditions, and Logic</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to do the above intelligent pop-up, the code needs to
                    identify text that is different in each cell and then remember it
                    when it spits out the pop-up box. This is done by defining a
                    variable and setting it to some value, depending on what was
                    clicked.
                </p>

                <p>The logic, in English, would be something like:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Look for mouse clicks once the page has finished loading.</li>
                    <li>
                        When a mouse click happens, figure out which part of the webpage
                        was clicked.
                    </li>
                    <li>Recognize that it was one of the cells in a calendar table.</li>
                    <li>Read the contents of the cell.</li>
                    <li>Store the contents into a variable to recall later.</li>
                    <li>Throw up a pop-up message.</li>
                    <li>
                        Put in the message some text that's different depending on what it
                        remembers from what was in the cell.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Generally, you want to plan out your functionality this way for each
                    bit of behavior that you want to program into the webpage. And, hey,
                    that list of things to do is actually called a "function!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    This way of thinking, where each step is spelled out and is required
                    for subsequent steps could be called a "logical flow," and being
                    able to do this well extends way past programming. Good research and
                    persuasive writing requires a logical flow of arguments to be
                    convincing. Playing strategy games requires some understanding of
                    conditions and consequences. Etc. This is why a lot of educational
                    researchers say that coding should be taught in K12 schools. It's
                    not so much that they want kids to be able to program stuff; the
                    real benefit is to help kids be able to think formally and
                    logically.
                </p>

                <h3>UPDATE!</h3>
                <p>
                    After actually coding in the calendar below, the actual order of
                    operations is:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Look for mouse clicks once the page has finished loading.</li>
                    <li>
                        When a mouse click happens, figure out if the element that the
                        mouse was over when it was clicked has an "onclick" attribute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        See that for any of the table cells, yes, there is an onclick
                        attribute associated with it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Execute whatever function was assigned to the onclick event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this case, it's a pop-up message (aka an "alert" function
                        that's built into Javascript).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make the alert say something based on which cell was clicked,
                        which passed a particular variable to the alert function (the
                        date)
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    This page has the example clickable calendar so you can look at the

                    to Javascript and programming, though, and it's much more complex
                    and complicated than straight up HTML and CSS. I feel like the best
                    way to learn would be follow a robust tutorial, so please confer the

Note: It's safe to declare variables and define functions within the head, but any functions that you invoke within the script block will execute as the page is loaded, so if it's in the head tag and the function tries to manipulate stuff in the body, it might not work since technically the stuff in the body doesn't yet exist.
  
              There's a few ways to declare variables in JS. It used to be you would use the word "var" then the variable name to tell the script that you want to create a new variable, but, more recently, "let" was introduced to help developers scope their variables, and there's, as far as I can tell, very few cases where you'd want to use var instead of let now.
              
              So the next few lines define some variables for the script to use. Variables are like addresses or labels you want to use to name bits of information you want the script to remember. In the first case, we're creating the label "today" and then assigning it a value of today's date. The words "new Date()" is telling the script to run a built-in function that returns the current date. It's like asking "What's today's date?" and it "returns" or responds with today's current date.
              
              The other variables are other built-in functions that are based off the date. "today.getMonth()" for example runs the function "getMonth()" on the variable that we set with "today." Since we just set today to the current date, the getMonth function can tell us the current month. */
        let today = new Date();
        let currentMonth = today.getMonth();
        let currentYear = today.getFullYear();

        /* The variable "months" here is being set to what's called an "array." It's like taking a group of data and clumping them together and giving them one name, sort of like how the variable "The Beatles" references John, Paul, George, and Ringo. What's neat about arrays is that the variable also remembers which order you put the items in, so you can later refer to specific items in the array by position. */
        let months = [
            "Jan",
            "Feb",
            "Mar",
            "Apr",
            "May",
            "Jun",
            "Jul",
            "Aug",
            "Sep",
            "Oct",
            "Nov",
            "Dec",
        ];

        /* The monthAndYear variable next is using Javascript's way of identifying an HTML element (aka tag) by referencing whatever CSS id you've given a particular element. This identification then lets you manipulate the text within the tag. In other words, if you look through the HTML, you'll eventually find something with the id "monthAndYear." Whatever HTML element has that id will get returned by the "getElementById("monthAndYear") function and then stored in a variable also called "monthAndYear." In this case, it's a h3 tag that we're using as the label for the calendar. The word "document" is sort of like a built-in variable that references the current HTML page you're working on. */
        let monthAndYear = document.getElementById("monthAndYear");

        let whatDay = document.getElementById("whatDay");

        /* The next line tells the script that you're going to define a function or a command you want it to execute whenever you invoke the keyword or name that you're giving the function.

        function showCalendar(month, year) {
            /* Here's some variables being defined within the function, which limits their scope to just the function.

It's prob not that big of a deal unless you're doing something really complicated or the user has multiple tabs and other apps open, though. */

It includes all the various elements (and the hierarchies for their nestings) and default variables or settings of the page. For example, the DOM specifies that there's only one html tag that begins and ends the whole document and that everything else needs to be in it. Likewise, td needs to be within a tr tag which in turn is within a table tag. Within the td is text that's displayed on the page. In the case below, we're setting the text of "monthAndYear" which is a h3 tag that we set earlier in this script to the current month and year. */
